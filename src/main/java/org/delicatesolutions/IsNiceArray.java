/*
An array is defined to be a Nice array if the sum of the primes in the array is equal to the first element of the array.
 If there are no primes in the array, the first element must be 0. So {21, 3, 7, 9, 11 4, 6} is a Nice array because 
 3, 7, 11 are the primes in the array and they sum to 21 which is the first element of the array. {13, 4, 4,4, 4} 
 is also a Nice array because the sum of the primes is 13 which is also the first element. 
 Other Nice arrays are {10, 5, 5}, {0, 6, 8, 20} and {3}. {8, 5, -5, 5, 3} is not a Nice array because the sum of the 
 primes is 5+5+3 = 13 but the first element of the array is 8. Note that -5 is not a prime because prime numbers are positive.
Write a function named isNiceArray that returns 1 if its integer array argument is a Nice array. Otherwise it returns 0.
The function signature is int isNiceArray (int[ ] a)
You may assume that a function named isPrime exists that returns 1 if its int argument is a prime, otherwise it returns 0.
You do **not** have to write this function! You just have to call it.
