/*
An array is defined to be a Bean array if the sum of the primes in the array is equal to the first element of the array. If there are no primes in the array, the first element must be 0. So {21, 3, 7, 9, 11 4, 6} is a Bean array because 3, 7, 11 are the primes in the array and they sum to 21 which is the first element of the array. {13, 4, 4,4, 4} is also a Bean array because the sum of the primes is 13 which is also the first element. Other Bean arrays are {10, 5, 5}, {0, 6, 8, 20} and {3}. {8, 5, ­5, 5, 3} is not a Bean array because the sum of the primes is 5+5+3 = 13 but the first element of the array is 8. Note that ­5 is not a prime because prime numbers are positive.
Write a function named isBeanArray that returns 1 if its integer array argument is a Bean array. Otherwise it returns 0. If you are writing in Java or C#, the function signature is
int isBeanArray (int[ ] a)
If you are writing in C or C++, the function signature is
int isBeanArray (int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
You may assume that a function named isPrime exists that returns 1 if its int argument is a prime,
 otherwise it returns 0. You do **not** have to write this function! You just have to call it.
