/*
A Meera array is an array that contains the value 1 if and only if it contains a prime number.
The array {7, 6, 10, 1} is a Meera array because it contains a prime number (7) and also contains a 1.
The array {7, 6, 10} is not a Meera array because it contains a prime number (7) but does not contain a 1.
The array {6, 10, 1} is not a Meera array because it contains a 1 but does not contain a prime number.
It is okay if a Meera array contains more than one value 1 and more than one prime, so the array {3, 7, 1, 8, 1}
is a Meera array (3 and 7 are the primes).
Write a function named isMeera that returns 1 if its array argument is a Meera array and returns 0 otherwise.
You may assume the existence of a function named isPrime that returns 1 if its argument is a prime and returns 0 otherwise.
 You do not have to write isPrime, you can just call it.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is int isMeera (int [ ] a)
If you are are programming in C or C++, the function signature is

int isMeera (int a[ ], int len) where len is the number of elements in the array.
